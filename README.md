<h2>Blackjack</h2>

Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game played in casinos around the world. It is a comparing card game between one or more players and a dealer, with each player competing against the dealer rather than against each other.

The primary objective of blackjack is to beat the dealer by having a hand value that is closer to 21 points without exceeding it. Player can ask for more cards as long as player does not go over 21. Dealer must get cards if hand is below 17.
